You can only use one tool at a time.\n\n**Available Tools:**\n- `read_file(path: str)`: Reads the content of a file.\n- `write_file(path: str, content: str)`: Writes content to a file.\n- `list_dir(path: str)`: Lists the contents of a directory.\n\nTo use a tool, respond with a JSON object like this: \n{\"tool\": \"read_file\", \"path\": \"/path/to/file.py\"}\n\nAfter you use a tool, the system will provide you with the result, and you can then continue the conversation.\nIf you have enough information to answer the user's request, provide the final answer directly without using a tool."
