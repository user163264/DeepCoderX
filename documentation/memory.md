# DeepCoderX Development Log - June 29, 2025

**Objective:** To transform the DeepCoderX application from an unstable prototype into a stable, feature-rich, and professionally structured command-line tool.

### **Session Summary**

This session was an intensive, end-to-end debugging and development sprint. We addressed a wide range of issues, from fundamental architectural flaws to subtle UI quirks, and implemented a comprehensive test suite to ensure long-term stability. The project is now in a stable, professional state.

### **1. Critical Bug Fixing and Architectural Stabilization**

*   **Import and Module Resolution:**
    *   **Problem:** The application was plagued by `ModuleNotFoundError` and `ImportError` exceptions due to an inconsistent and incorrect import structure.
    *   **Solution:** We systematically refactored all import statements in both the application source code (`services/`, `models/`, `utils/`) and the test suite to be absolute from the project root. We then created a `pytest.ini` file to configure the `pythonpath`, ensuring the test runner could correctly discover all modules.

*   **AI Tool-Use Conversation Loop:**
    *   **Problem:** The AI models were getting "stuck in a loop," repeatedly calling tools without providing a final answer. This was caused by two issues: the inability to handle multiple tool calls in a single response, and ambiguous system prompts.
    *   **Solution:** We re-implemented the tool-use loop in both the `LocalCodingHandler` and `DeepSeekAnalysisHandler` to correctly parse and execute multiple tool calls in a single turn. We also refined the system prompts to provide explicit instructions and examples for tool usage, which resolved the model's confusion.

*   **Configuration and Environment:**
    *   **Problem:** The application was failing with `401 Unauthorized` errors because it could not reliably find the `.env` file.
    *   **Solution:** We made the `.env` loading process more robust by using an absolute path from the `config.py` file, ensuring the `MCP_API_KEY` is always loaded correctly.

*   **UI and Concurrency:**
    *   **Problem:** The application was crashing with `KeyboardInterrupt` race conditions, and the UI was suffering from a variety of syntax errors, `NameError` exceptions, and `TypeError` exceptions.
    *   **Solution:** We implemented a graceful shutdown mechanism to correctly handle `Ctrl+C`, and we systematically debugged and fixed all of the UI-related syntax and runtime errors.

### **2. Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation**

*   **Framework Setup:** We established a professional testing framework using `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, and `requests-mock`.
*   **Test Coverage:** We created a comprehensive test suite with **17 tests** across **7 files**, covering all critical components of the application.
*   **Test Quality:** The suite includes unit tests, integration tests, and error-case tests, providing a high degree of confidence in the application's stability.
*   **User-Friendly Test Runner:** We created the `run_tests.py` script to provide a simple, one-command way to execute the entire suite.

### **3. UI/UX Enhancements**

*   **Live, Flicker-Free Interface:** We completely rewrote the main application loop to use `rich.Live` and a non-blocking input mechanism. This resolved all UI issues, including the "jumping" screen, slow typing, and the appearance of mouse scroll characters.
*   **Custom Progress Indicator:** We implemented a custom progress bar that displays a rotating list of "silly messages" and a timer that correctly shows the total time taken for each command.
*   **Scrollable History:** The main content area now correctly maintains a full, scrollable history of the user's session.
*   **Dynamic Model Name Display:** The assistant's responses are now correctly labeled with the name of the AI model that generated them.

### **4. Professional Project Management**

*   **Git Repository and Workflow:** We initialized a Git repository, created a `.gitignore` file, and established a best-practice `main` / `develop` branching strategy.
*   **Documentation:** We created several new documentation files, including `CREDITS.md`, a codebase analysis report, and a detailed implementation plan for future work.

**Conclusion:** This session was a success. We have transformed the DeepCoderX project into a stable, reliable, and user-friendly application with a professional development workflow. It is now in an excellent position for future development.
