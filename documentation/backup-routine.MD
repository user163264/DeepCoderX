  End-of-Session Workflow (Your Backup Routine)

  Step 1: Stage Your Changes


  First, you need to tell Git which files you want to include in your
  backup. The easiest way to do this is to add all the files you've
  changed.


   1 git add .



   * What it does: This command looks at all the files in your project and
      adds any new or modified ones to a "staging area," getting them
     ready for the next step.

  ---

  Step 2: Commit Your Changes

  Next, you need to create a "commit." A commit is like a permanent, named
   snapshot of your work at a specific point in time. It's the most
  important part of the local backup process.



   1 git commit -m "A clear message about what you did"



   * What it does: This takes everything from your staging area and saves
     it to your local Git history with a descriptive message.
   * Good Commit Messages: It's a very good practice to write clear commit
      messages. For example:
       * git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication"
       * git commit -m "fix: Corrected the test suite import errors"
       * git commit -m "docs: Update the project README file"

  Step 3: Push Your Commits to GitHub

  Now that you have saved your work locally, this is the final step to
  create your off-site backup.


   1 git push


   * What it does: This command takes all the new commits you've made
     locally and uploads them to your GitHub repository.

  Summary

  So, to answer your question directly: Yes, `git push` is how you back
  up your work, but only after you have used `git add` and `git commit`
  to save your changes locally first.

  Your end-of-session routine should always be:


   1. git add .
   2. git commit -m "Your message"
   3. git push


  Following this simple process will ensure that your work is always
  safely backed up and that you have a clear history of all the changes
  you've made.




  âœ¦ That is a fantastic and very common question. It gets to the core of how
   Git works locally.


  The key concept to understand is that you still only have one project
  folder locally. The different branches (main and develop) are not
  separate folders on your machine. Instead, they are like different
  states or timelines within that single folder.

  How it Works Locally


  Think of your /Users/admin/Documents/DeepCoderX folder as a
  "workspace." Git manages the files within this workspace.


   * The `.git` Directory: Inside your project folder, there is a hidden
     .git directory. This is Git's brain. It stores the complete history
     of your project, including all the commits and all the branches.


   * `git checkout` (The "Time Machine"): When you use the git checkout
     command, you are telling Git to change the state of your workspace to
      match a specific branch.
       * When you run git checkout develop, Git looks at the latest commit
          on the develop branch and makes all the files in your workspace
         match that commit.
       * When you run git checkout main, Git does the same for the main
         branch, instantly changing the files to match that state.

  Analogy: A Book with Multiple Bookmarks


   * Your project folder is the book.
   * The .git directory is the index at the back of the book, which knows
     where every word and every page is.
   * Your branches (main, develop) are bookmarks.
   * When you git checkout develop, you are telling Git to open the book
     to the develop bookmark. The content of the pages (your files)
     instantly reflects that point in the story.

  Your Local Workflow


  So, locally, you will always work in the same
  /Users/admin/Documents/DeepCoderX folder. The only thing that changes
  is which branch you have "checked out."

  Here is your typical workflow:

   1. Start your work:


   1     cd /Users/admin/Documents/DeepCoderX
   2     git checkout develop

   2. Do your coding: Make changes, add new files, fix bugs, etc.
   3. Save your work:


   1     git add .
   2     git commit -m "A message about your changes"
   3     git push origin develop

   4. When you are ready for a new "stable" release:

   1     git checkout main
   2     git merge develop
   3     git push origin main



  You never need to have two separate project folders on your machine.
  Git handles all the complexity of managing the different versions of
  your files for you
