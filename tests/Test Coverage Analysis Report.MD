Test Coverage Analysis Report

 1 Current Test Structure (from project context):

 • Located in /Users/admin/Documents/DeepCoderX/tests
 • Key test files mentioned:
    • test_auto_implement_handler.py
    • test_filesystem_handler.py
    • test_llm_handlers.py
    • test_tool_loop.py
    • test_syntax.py (moved to utils)

 2 Coverage Gaps Identified:

 • No explicit tests for:
    • MCP server/client security validation
    • Dual-AI architecture integration
    • Context building and management
    • NLU parser edge cases
    • Router command validation

 3 Recommended Test Improvements:

 • Add integration tests for:
    • MCP security sandboxing
    • AI model switching logic
    • Tool-use conversation flows
 • Expand unit tests for:
    • All service layer components
    • Error handling scenarios
    • Configuration validation

 4 Test Quality Recommendations:

 • Implement coverage tracking
 • Add performance benchmarks
 • Include security validation tests
 • Add negative test cases

 5 Implementation Plan:

 1 First create test coverage baseline
 2 Identify critical missing test areas
 3 Implement prioritized test cases
 4 Establish CI/CD test pipeline

Would you like me to proceed with generating specific test files for any of these areas? I can provide
template test cases for the highest priority components first.
