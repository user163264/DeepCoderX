### **Core AI and Machine Learning**

*   **[Qwen (by Alibaba Cloud)](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2):** The powerful and efficient open-source language model that serves as the primary local coding assistant for DeepCoderX.

*   **[llama.cpp (by Georgi Gerganov and contributors)](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp):** The foundational C++ inference engine that makes it possible to run large language models efficiently on consumer hardware.

*   **[llama-cpp-python (by Andrei Abacaru and contributors)](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python):** The essential Python bindings for `llama.cpp`. This library is the bridge that allows DeepCoderX to interact directly with the local GGUF model.

### **Development Framework and Libraries**

*   **[Python](https://www.python.org/):** The core programming language used for the entire application.

*   **[pytest](https://pytest.org/):** The framework used for our comprehensive test suite. Its powerful features and clear syntax have been essential for ensuring the stability and reliability of the application.

*   **[Rich (by Will McGugan)](https://github.com/Textualize/rich):** The library responsible for the beautiful and user-friendly text formatting in the command-line interface.

*   **[Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** The library used for making robust and reliable HTTP requests to the DeepSeek API.

### **Command-Line Interface and User Experience**

*   **[gnureadline](https://github.com/ludwig-gramberg/gnureadline):** The library that provides essential command history and line editing capabilities, significantly improving the user experience on macOS.
