CONTEXT FILE FOR PROJECT.
-----------------------------

## START RULES ##
- 1: read THIS document to understandand the project (location of files, project tree, ...)
- 2: start your entry with[DATE] [NAME-OF-MODEL] [TIME]
- 3: only write what you did to the code. Then - what did you change? why? explain. Stay professional and brief.
- 4: Stay on topic.
- 5: DO NOT ERASE or REPLACE TEXT. Just add. So it becomes a real log file.
- 6: ADD YOUR ENTRY IN THE MEMORY FILE WITHOUT COMPLETELY REWRITING IT.
- 7:keep the file clean.
- 8: NEVER USE MOCK DATA OR MOCK REPLIES

# EXAMPLES: #

EXAMPLE: GOOD

**June 19, 2025 - 14:45**: COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE ANALYSIS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CREATED - Current state assessment and Phase 2 completion roadmap established
- **Analysis completed**: Thorough review of Genesis project current state via memory file, PROJECT_STATE.json, and filesystem examination
- **Current project status verified**:
  - **Genesis server**: OPERATIONAL on port 11436 with complete conversation system, real AI models (llama3.2:3b, qwen2.5-coder:1.5b), optimized streaming, MCP protocol integration
  - **Genesis CLI**: Advanced orchestration engine complete (2325+ lines), terminal UI operational, but missing versioning service implementation
  - **Phase 2 gap identified**: CLI conversation management commands exist (commit/checkout/log/branch/status) but corresponding server-side versioning service incomplete
- **Critical findings**:
  - Database schema and models for versioning already created (`/genesis-server/ollama/genesis/conversations/versioning/schema.go`, `models.go`)
  - CLI commands implemented and ready (`/genesis-cli/cmd/conversation/`) targeting versioning endpoints
