## Project Architecture Analysis

### 1. Core Architecture Components

#### **Dual-AI Model Strategy**
The project implements an innovative approach using two distinct AI systems:

1. **Local GGUF Model (Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B)**
   - Powered by `llama-cpp-python`
   - Fast, efficient for general coding tasks
   - Starts with clean context, builds understanding on-demand
   - Tool-use enabled for file system operations

2. **Cloud API (DeepSeek)**
   - High-powered analysis for complex codebase understanding
   - Pre-loaded with project context for deep analysis
   - Advanced reasoning capabilities for architectural decisions

#### **Security Architecture (MCP)**
The Managed Code Protocol implementation is a standout feature:

#### **Key Strengths:**

1. **Modular Design**: Clear separation between concerns (routing, security, AI handling)
2. **Configuration Management**: Centralized, validated configuration with environment variables
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
4. **Tool-Use Framework**: Sophisticated multi-turn conversation loops for AI agents
5. **Security-First Approach**: All file operations routed through sandboxed MCP server

#### **Technical Implementation Highlights:**

**Multi-Tool Call Support:**
```python
# Both local and DeepSeek handlers support multiple tool calls per turn
tool_call_matches = re.findall(r'\{.*\}', model_response_text, re.DOTALL)
for tool_call_json in tool_call_matches:
    # Execute each tool and collect results
    tool_results.append(self._execute_tool(response_json))
```

**Context Management:**
```python
# Smart context building for project understanding
class ContextManager:
    def build_and_save_context(self) -> str:
        file_tree = self._get_file_tree()
        project_description = self._get_project_description()
        # Creates comprehensive project context file
```

**Natural Language Understanding:**
```python
# Converts natural language to structured commands
class NLUParser:
    def parse_intent(self, command_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Uses LLM to convert natural language to JSON commands
        # Includes confidence scoring and retry logic
```

        if not sandbox.exists():
            raise ValueError(f"Sandbox path does not exist: {self.SANDBOX_PATH}")
    
    # Runtime validation of critical settings
    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name == "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY" and value:
            if not re.match(r'^sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{24}$', value):
